        Hi! I'm Drihan, a student and aspiring game designer with a passion for building digital experiences. 
        I'm currently learning web development, and I enjoy working with
        tools like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
        I like building things that look good and feel good to use. This site is a part of that vision.
